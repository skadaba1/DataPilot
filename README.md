# Harvest.ai
TODO
- Build functionality for database upload
- Pass databases as strings to query
- Build some chain of thought prompting
- Add auto-suggestions (can be triggered rule-based) so users don't have to submit questions before recieving feedback
- Ideal Demo
  - Upload Non-linear dataset
  - Use linear regression in code --> copilot points out error by training on dataset
  - Use an example where a previous user builds a function to do something and you also want to do that same thing so it lets you know
10. Spreadsheet capability?
